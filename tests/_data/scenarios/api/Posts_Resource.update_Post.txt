I WANT TO UPDATE POST

I send put "$this->endpoint."/$id""," ['title' => 'Lord of Thrones']" 
I see response code is "200" 
I see response is json "" 
I see response contains json "['title' => 'Lord of Thrones']" 
I see record 'posts'," ['title' => 'Lord of Thrones']" 
I don't see record 'posts'," ['title' => 'Game of Thrones']"
