I WANT TO GET ALL POSTS

I send get "$this->endpoint" 
I see response code is "200" 
I see response is json "" 
I expect 'both items are in response' 
I see response contains json "['id' => $id"," 'title' => 'Game of Thrones'," 'body' => 'Body']" 
I see response contains json "['id' => $id2"," 'title' => 'Lord of the Rings'," 'body' => 'Body']" 
I expect 'both items are in root array' 
I see response contains json "[['id' => $id]"," ['id' => $id2]]"
